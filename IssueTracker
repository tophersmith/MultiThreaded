NEAR-TERM
add better logger use/exceptions

brute generator is stupidly slow
	just use char array, previous guess + max producertype thread, use the charSet as boundaries.
	try to avoid touching BigInteger
	need to have a way to say guess the next x guesses (AtomicLong?)

revamp class structure/finalize members/check access allowances

JUnit Tests **STARTED**

yourkit tests like mad
	should execution contexts come from a pool?



DISTRIBUTED
Build client/server

build frontend for server

build server support for dropped clients
	client heartbeat?
	server chunks work to each client, marks as done and deletes when client checks in?
		no heartbeat for x time, ping client, no response, issue error, send failed chunk to a new client
	
build server support for adding new clients
	new client checks in, registers, accepts new work

support sending potentially large files
	and message passing for too large for filesystem
	and cleanup (hash of file to check how long to keep)


WISHLIST
upgrade clients???

rules generator/hybrid generator
